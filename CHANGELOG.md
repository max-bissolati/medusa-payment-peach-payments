# Changelog

## Unreleased, 2026-10-07

- Protected main with required pull requests, passing CI, resolved conversations, and blocks on
  force pushes and deletion, including administrators.
- Updated CI and release actions to current pinned revisions and added Node 24 coverage.
- Migrated the release workflow from the missing npm token to OIDC trusted publishing on Node 24
  with npm 11.18.0. The npm owner must configure the matching publisher before the next release.
- Added `docs/RELEASING.md` and corrected stale release-maintenance instructions.

## 2026-09-10 (v0.1.5)

Docs only, no code changes. Updated GitHub username references to lowercase (max-bissolati) after the
account rename. Old-case URLs still resolve (usernames are case-insensitive), so nothing was broken.

## 2026-09-10 (v0.1.4)

Docs only, no code changes. README: title rendered in Title Case, the hero's circle motif removed,
and em-dashes removed throughout.

## 2026-09-10 (v0.1.3)

Docs only, no code changes. Removed the animated typing banner from the README.

## 2026-09-10 (v0.1.2)

Docs only, no code changes. Beautified the README — project-native hero, status badges, and a
value-first layout. Published package behaviour is unchanged.

## 2026-09-10 (v0.1.1)

Docs only, no code changes. Generalized the provenance and origin wording in the README and the
extraction verification notes: the verification findings are retained in full, with the specific
tools, models, and systems used to run them removed. Published package behaviour is unchanged.

## 2026-07-07 (v0.1.0 published)

First public release. Repo live at github.com/max-bissolati/medusa-payment-peach-payments,
package published to npm as medusa-payment-peach-payments@0.1.0 through the release
workflow with provenance, after a green CI run on Node 20 and 22. A pre-publish leak audit
(one adversarial reviewer over the working tree, full git history, and the extracted
tarball including decoded sourcemaps, plus a second independent review) found no
credentials, internal references, or private names; the repo history was squashed to a
single clean commit before the first push. One operational note: the first CI runs crawled
because the hosted runner's route to the npm CDN was degraded (46 to 86 seconds per large
tarball); nothing in the repo was at fault and the run passed once left to finish.

## 2026-07-07 (verification loop closed: sandbox E2E, independent review, CI fix)

The adversarial verification loop completed. The full record lives in
verifications/extraction-v0.1/FINDINGS_LOG.md; the short version:

- **Sandbox end to end: pass.** The packed tarball, installed into a scratch Medusa app
  (Medusa 2.17.2, Docker Postgres), drove a real Peach sandbox checkout: OAuth +
  /v2/checkouts, hosted-page card payment with a test Visa, cart completion through the
  /status re-confirmation and amount-integrity gate (order created, 100.00 ZAR captured,
  result code 000.100.110), and a full V1 HMAC refund accepted by Peach. No plugin bugs.
  Caveat: the sandbox entity runs in Integrator Test Mode, so the 3DS challenge path was
  not exercised.
- **Independent review (five single-concern briefs): GO** on amount/currency,
  result codes, webhook HMAC, and lifecycle/client (zero critical/high/medium, each
  confirmed by two runs). The packaging review found one real bug and one gap, both fixed:
- **CI leak assertions were inert (high).** The negated grep checks in test.yml could
  never fail the job because bash's `set -e` ignores `!`-inverted commands. A src/ or
  examples/ leak in the publish artifact would have passed CI silently. Rewritten as
  positive-logic ifs; release.yml now runs the same artifact assertions before publish.
- **Exports map advertised unreachable subpaths (medium).** The `./*` catch-all pointed
  directory modules (like the admin bundle) at flat files that do not exist. Added an
  explicit `./admin` export; the documented `providers/peach` path was always correct.
- Also: two stale JSDoc comments said the webhook path was `peach_<id>`; it is
  `pp_peach_<id>`. Remaining LOW notes from the reviewers are recorded in BACKLOG.md as
  non-blocking polish.

## 2026-07-07 (red-team round: hardening, lockfile, shipped types)

A red-team pass over the extracted plugin confirmed eight findings. All fixed at the root, each
with regression tests where applicable. Suite grew from 130 to 182 tests, all green.

- **Lockfile broke `npm ci` on Node 22 (high).** The committed lockfile tripped npm's
  optional-peer bug around `fdir@6.1.1` / `picomatch` ("Invalid: lock file's picomatch@2.3.2 does
  not satisfy picomatch@3.0.2"). Regenerated `package-lock.json` with npm 11.18.0 and verified a
  fresh `npm ci` under npm 10.9.8 (Node 22), npm 11.13 (Node 24), and npm 11.18. The test
  workflow now runs a Node 20/22 matrix so this class of break is caught in CI, and `.nvmrc`
  pins 20 for local work.
- **No TypeScript declarations shipped (medium).** The tarball had zero `.d.ts` and the exports
  map had no `types` condition, so TS consumers hit TS7016. The build now runs a
  declaration-only `tsc` pass (`tsconfig.declarations.json`) after `medusa plugin:build`, the
  exports map carries `types` conditions, and the public types (`PeachOptions` and friends) are
  re-exported from the provider index. Verified with a strict-TS scratch project compiling
  against the packed tarball. `prepublishOnly` now runs the full build so a publish can't ship
  without types.
- **Refund currency not normalized (low).** `resolveCurrency()` now uppercases at the single
  root and rejects anything that isn't a 3-letter ISO code, before any network call, in both the
  initiate and refund paths. `PeachClient.refund` also uppercases and validates, since the
  currency is part of the signed V1 message.
- **`amountsMatch(" ", "0.00")` returned true (low).** `Number(" ")` is 0. String inputs are now
  trimmed before the empty check on both sides, so whitespace-only amounts fail closed.
- **Result-code regex hardening (low).** Codes containing any whitespace are rejected before
  matching, buckets match the full `ddd.ddd.ddd` token instead of a prefix (so
  "000.000.000extra" is no longer success), and the `000.400.0x` class is digits-only. A
  table-driven test snapshots the pre-hardening mapping for every real code and asserts it is
  unchanged; only junk inputs moved (all to `error`).
- **Malformed `resultCodeOverrides` values passed through (low).** `validateOptions` now rejects
  any override value that isn't a legal Medusa payment session status, at boot, naming the
  offending key and value. Credential validation stays permissive as before.
- **Repo hygiene.** Deleted the stale `medusa-payment-peach-payments-0.1.0.tgz` at the repo root.
- **Docs.** README limitations now note the ~9e13 minor-unit float-precision bound, the options
  reference points at the exported `PeachOptions` type instead of an unshipped source path, and
  a new note explains that a bare `require("medusa-payment-peach-payments")` is not exported by design.
  `authorizePayment` gained a comment recording why `session.data.amount` is trustworthy
  (Medusa spreads provider-returned session data last; verified against @medusajs/payment 2.13.x).

Final gate: fresh `npm ci`, typecheck, 182 tests, `npm run build`, and an `npm pack` whose
tarball contains the compiled `.js` plus `.d.ts`, no `src/`, no `examples/`, no specs, and zero
hits on the private-name leak grep.

## 2026-07-07 (docs + examples)

Replaced the stub README with the real one: what the provider is (and isn't, unaffiliated,
unofficial), requirements, install, a fully-commented registration snippet covering every
`PeachOptions` key, an env-var naming table, the completion model, webhook setup (URL derivation,
why no body-parser config is needed), refunds, sandbox testing with public test-card numbers, a
factual hardening section, and the limitations (two-decimal currencies only, no ZAR default, no
cancel endpoint). Split the webhook signature/verification detail into `docs/WEBHOOKS.md` so the
README stays scannable.

Added `examples/storefront/`: a Next.js/React reference adapted from a real storefront integration
covering the full flow: reading the active session off the cart (`lib/peach.ts`), mounting the
embedded widget (`checkout-payment.tsx`), and the authorize-on-return handler
(`peach-result/`). All store-specific naming, domains, and business logic (shipping-size
tiers, hardcoded provinces, geolocation autofill) were scrubbed or, where they didn't adapt
cleanly, left out. The Embedded Express (Apple/Google Pay) example was skipped for that reason,
and the omission is explained in `examples/storefront/README.md`. Test-card numbers and the
webhook/embedded-SDK links were sourced fresh from developer.peachpayments.com, not carried over
from the private integration this was extracted from.

No source changes. Read `src/` for accuracy while writing but found nothing worth flagging.

## 2026-07-07

Initial extraction. The provider was generalized from a production Medusa v2 Peach Payments (Checkout V2) integration: checkout creation, authorize-on-return with an amount-integrity gate, verified webhooks that re-confirm outcome and amount against GET /status (fail closed), and V1 HMAC refunds that treat a declined-but-HTTP-200 refund as a failure.

Generalized for public use:

- No hardcoded currency or country. `defaultCurrency` and `defaultCountryCode` options replace the ZAR/ZA literals; with no session currency and no default the provider throws a clear error, and the billing country is omitted entirely when unknown.
- `resultCodeOverrides` option: a per-code map checked before the built-in result-code buckets. Overriding a fail-closed decline/error to a success status logs a warning once per code. Without overrides the mapping is identical to the production behaviour.
- Refund error messages are currency-neutral.

Scrubbed on the way out: host-project names and URLs (replaced with example.com fixtures), store-specific references (replaced with neutral wording), and realistic fixture data (replaced with obviously fake names, phone numbers and ids). The store-specific shipping-validation hook was left behind; the Embedded Express wallet-address helper and route moved to examples/embedded-express as an uncompiled recipe.

All money-safety hardening carried over unchanged: the amount-integrity gate in authorizePayment, the webhook /status re-confirmation with no body-amount fallback, and every fail-closed path.
